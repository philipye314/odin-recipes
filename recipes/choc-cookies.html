        <p><em>Makes 24 cookies</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li>
            <li>3/4 brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>8 tablespoons butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>150g flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Into a large bowl, combine your softened butter and sugar.
                <em>Make sure the butter is soft enough to combine</em> and mix.
                Afterwards, add in the 2 eggs and mix until just combined.
                Add in a dash of vanilla extract and mix again.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                Mix together flour and baking powder in a bowl. Combine the dry ingredients
                into the bowl with the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.
                When this is finished, fold in the chocolate chips until again the mixture is just
                combined. <strong>Note: It is important to mix until just combined, 
                otherwise your cookies won't be as soft and malleable</strong>
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Chill dough for at least 30 minutes or leave in the freezer up to a week.
                When you are ready, scoop out tablespoon sized bunches of dough onto parchment
                paper and bake at 350 F for 8-12 minutes. Enjoy!
