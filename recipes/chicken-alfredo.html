        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Maybe you were looking for something heavier, more potent after the two previous recipes. This chicken alfredo is the perfect,
            creamy, recipe with a little kick from the cajun seasoning. The key to making a good alredo sauce is enough seasoning
            and not too much cream, otherwise it will just become a thick coating of nothingness. This recipe takes care of that issue
            by creating the perfect balance of spices yet creaminess, topped with mouth-watering chicken.

            <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1 pound boneless chicken breasts <em>(or thighs)</em></li>
            <li>2 tsp cajun seasoning</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup dry white wine <em>(or chicken broth)</em></li>
            <li>3/4 cup freshly shaved parmesan</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy/whipping cream</li> 
            <li>Cajun seasoning to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook pasta as directed on package</li>
            <li>While pasta is cooking, heat oil and melt butter in a skillet
                over medium-high heat, season chicken with cajun, add to pan and sear until cooked,
                about 3-5 minutes, pull out when done and set aside
            </li>
            <li>Add garlic to pan and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute</li>
            <li>Add wine to pan and deglaze by scraping off any bits from the bottom. Alternatively, if using chicken broth, add it in now and do the same.</li>
            <li>When the wine has reduced to about half its original volume, add heavy cream, parmesan, and cajun seasoning to taste.
                Continue mixing and tasting until everything has blended to a nice consistency, about 3-5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Mix in pasta with a little pasta water as to bind sauce to the pasta, and top with cooked chicken. Enjoy!</li>
