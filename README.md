# odin-recipes
My First Project using the Odin Project - A recipe website in HTML
This project while demonstrate my ability to use links, images, file organization, and other key concepts of HTML.

Reflection:
I learned how to create links to different pages within a web, implemented images, unordered lists, and ordered list. I gained experience in manipulating different elements, along with combinations of those elements, in order to create something like a recipe book.
